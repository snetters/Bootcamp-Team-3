            With recent events, the world is beginning to turn around. We have
            witnessed the countless injustices done to people. From Breonna
            Taylor to Ahmaud Aubrey to George Floyd, and sadly, many more.
          </p>
          <p>
            As such, people are now tired of the mistreatment and are standing
            up to these unspeakable acts. We are now fighting against these
            injustices. Many fight through protests, others through petitions
            and donations.
          </p>
          <p>
            FundFlow is here to help those of us who are fighting through
            donations. Many organizations and movements are asking for
            donations, but we must remain vigilante and make sure these
            organizations are legitimate and are using your money for a greater
            purpose. We want to make sure your donation is purposefully used and
            help ease any worries you may have.
